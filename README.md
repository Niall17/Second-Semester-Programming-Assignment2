# Second-Semester-Programming-Assignment2
Object Oriented Programming Semester 2: Assignment 2

In this assignment we need to create a series of methods that can check to see if a number entered is a palindrome, this means when read backwards and forwards it is still the same eg. 8558. We also need to create a binary conversion method to check binary palindromes too. 
Method one takes in a string and reverses it and compares the original to the reversed string.
Method two compares the string on an element by element basis, first to last, second to second last, and so on.
Method three places each element on a stack and queue and when full compares the elements of each.
